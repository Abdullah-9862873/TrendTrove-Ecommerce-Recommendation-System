In order to run the app you need to follow the steps:

Step 1: Install the node modules in the main folder by "npm install"

Step 2: Install the node modules in the frontend folder by "npm install"

Step 3: Now if you only want to run the frontend then "npm run frontend" and if you want only to run the backend then "npm run backend" but if you want to run them both simultaneously then "npm run dev" in the main folder terminal

Step 4: Now that your frontend and backend is running you need to run one more thing and that is inside "recommendations system" and that is "finalapi.py" You need to enter "python finalapi.py" to run that

And now all set...
